  // Purchase Intent
  purchase_intent?: 'primary_residence' | 'investment' | 'vacation_home' | 'exploring';
  timeline?: 'immediate' | 'next_3_months' | 'next_6_months' | 'next_year' | 'just_looking';
  
  // Financial

  lead_score?: LeadScore;
  questions_asked: string[];
  qualification_complete: boolean;
  next_qualification_opportunity?: string;
  qualification_progress: number; // 0-100%
}
```

### 2. Qualification Node Implementation (`src/agents/nodes/qualifyLead.ts`)

```typescript
// Core qualification logic with natural conversation integration
export async function qualifyLead(state: GraphState): Promise<Partial<GraphState>> {
  // 1. Analyze current conversation for qualification opportunities
  // 2. Determine best qualification question based on context
  // 3. Integrate question naturally into response
  // 4. Update qualification state and lead score
  // 5. Trigger actions if score thresholds are met
}
```

### 3. Lead Scoring Algorithm (`src/lib/lead-scoring.ts`)

```typescript
// Weighted scoring system
const SCORING_WEIGHTS = {
  intent: {
    'investment': 25,
    'primary_residence': 20,
    'vacation_home': 15,
    'exploring': 5
  },
  timeline: {
    'immediate': 25,
    'next_3_months': 20,
    'next_6_months': 15,
    'next_year': 10,
    'just_looking': 2
  },
  budget: {
    'above_35m': 25,
    '25m_35m': 20,
    '15m_25m': 15,
    'under_15m': 10,
    'flexible': 12
  },
  authority: {
    'sole_decision': 25,
    'spouse_consultation': 18,
    'family_decision': 12,
    'business_partners': 8
  }
};
```

### 4. Conversation Flow Integration

Update `villa-graph.ts` to include qualification at strategic points:

```typescript
// Add qualification node
graph.addNode("qualifyLead", qualifyLead);

// Add conditional edges for qualification triggers
graph.addConditionalEdges(
  "generateResponse",
  (state: GraphState) => {
    // Check if qualification opportunity exists
    if (shouldTriggerQualification(state)) {
      return "qualifyLead";
    }
    return "__end__";
  },
  {
    qualifyLead: "qualifyLead",
    __end__: "__end__"
  }
);
```

## Conversation Strategy Design

### Question Integration Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Context-Triggered Questions
```
User: "What's the price of Villa Anna?"
Bot: "Villa Anna ranges from ₱17M to ₱23M depending on the unit and payment plan. Are you looking at this as an investment property or for personal use? This helps me recommend the best payment option for you."
```

#### Pattern 2: Natural Follow-ups
```
User: "I'm interested in the rental income potential."
Bot: "Great! Villa Anna can generate ₱15K-₱25K per night on Airbnb. Are you planning to use it sometimes yourself, or would this be purely an investment property?"
```

#### Pattern 3: Helpful Clarifications
```
User: "When can I move in?"
Bot: "Villa Anna will be completed by July 2025. Is this timeline working for your plans? Are you looking to relocate to Siargao or use it as a vacation home?"
```

### Qualification Sequence Priority

**High Priority (Ask Early):**
1. Purchase intent (investment vs personal use)
2. Timeline for decision/purchase
3. Budget comfort zone

**Medium Priority (Ask Mid-Conversation):**
4. Decision-making authority
5. Siargao familiarity
6. Payment preference

**Low Priority (Ask When Appropriate):**
7. Demographics
8. Contact preferences
9. Follow-up consent
