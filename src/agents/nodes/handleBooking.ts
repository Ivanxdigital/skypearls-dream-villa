**üöó Property Location & Directions:**
Our property is located past the airport. Keep going straight and you'll see the airport's runway on your left-hand side. Continue straight for another 10 seconds and you'll see a blue fence with "Skypearls Realty" on the tarpaulin. After passing that blue fence, you'll find an off-road access on the right-hand side that leads to our property.
